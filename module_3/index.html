                        	The final evolution of the Joker took a sinister twist back to his roots. In the 2008 film The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger played the darkest version of the Joker yet. The entire film was a social commentary on the War on Terror and the Joker was the symbol of the Taliban and the fear that accompanies it (Message Movies?). The Joker still lacked a plan, mirroring the Taliban’s lack of plan in their holy war against the West. The Heath Ledger Joker said “Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I’m a dog chasing cars. I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it. You know, I just… do things.” ("The 13 Best Quotes by the Joker in The Dark Night). This quote perfectly sums up the ideology that the Joker shares with Jihadis worldwide. They don’t have a true plan, as Alfred Pennyworth put it, “Some men just want to watch the world burn.” ("Memorable quotes for The Dark Knight") This new generation Joker started out as a common criminal, robbing banks-until Batman put pressure on him. Batman saw his potential and tried to stop him; in doing so, he put the Joker in panic mode. The Joker started fighting back with everything he had and ended up putting the city on the verge of anarchy. The Dark Knight Joker’s crimes and style almost perfectly mirrored that of the terror cells in the Middle East. He blew up public buildings, announced his plans through cell phone video, and even managed to turn the hero of the city into a hate fuelled, cold blooded killer. Throughout his career, the Joker has mirrored the current terror cell in power. In the 1940s, it was the Axis powers; in the 1960s, he and the terrorists took a break; and in 2008, the Joker came back in full force to symbolize the Taliban. Through the years, the Joker has shaped society’s view on the world’s evil. One can only imagine what the Joker would think about his impact on society, but it can be inferred that through this quote that he would be proud of his accomplishments: “This city deserves a better class of criminal. And I’m going to give it to them”.
